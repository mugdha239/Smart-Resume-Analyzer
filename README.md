Objective: Create a system that uses Machine Learning (ML), Natural
Language Processing (NLP), Big Data, and Blockchain technologies to analyze
resumes, match candidates with job requirements, and verify certifications.

A. Requirements
1. Data Collection
• Collect resumes from applicants in formats like PDF and DOCX.
• Gather job descriptions from employers.
• Obtain verified certification data from educational institutions.
2. Infrastructure
• Use powerful computing resources to train ML models.
• Store data securely using local storage solutions.
• Use Blockchain to securely verify certifications, utilizing platforms like
Hyperledger or Ethereum.
3. Software & Tools
• Employ Big Data frameworks such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.
• Use ML libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-Learn.
• Apply NLP libraries including NLTK, SpaCy, and BERT.
• Develop Blockchain solutions using tools like Solidity and Hyperledger
Composer.
• Process data with tools like Pandas and NumPy.

B. Processing Steps
1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
• Collect resumes and job descriptions.
• Clean and prepare structured data from job descriptions.
• Process unstructured resume data by breaking it into meaningful pieces.
• Combine data from different sources into a single system.
2. NLP Processing
• Use NLP techniques to extract skills, education, and experience from
resumes.
• Extract key phrases and important information from job descriptions to
match candidates accurately.
3. Blockchain Integration
• Create smart contracts to record and verify certifications on Blockchain.
• Ensure data is secure and trustworthy using Blockchain technology.
4. Model Development
• Matching Model: Build models to match resumes to job descriptions
based on skills and experience.
• b. Sentiment Analysis Model: Analyze feedback and reviews from
previous employers using NLP.
5. System Integration
• Combine ML models and Blockchain components with the job application
system.
• Develop a dashboard for real-time monitoring of job applications and
matches.
• Create an alert system to notify users of potential matches and issues.
6. Testing and Validation
• Test the system using historical data to ensure it works correctly.
• Validate model performance with metrics like accuracy and precision.
• Test the system’s ability to handle large amounts of data and transactions.

C. Expected Outcomes
1. Improved Matching Accuracy
• Better matching of candidates to job openings, saving time for recruiters.
2. Certification Verification
• Reliable verification of certifications with secure, immutable records.
3. Data-Driven Insights
• Better understanding of candidate profiles and factors influencing job matches.

D. Deliverables
1. Smart Resume Analyzer System
• A functional system that integrates NLP, ML, and Blockchain.
• A user-friendly dashboard for managing and monitoring applications.
2. Technical Documentation
• Detailed explanations of data handling, ML models, and Blockchain
integration.
• API documentation for system integration.
3. Performance Report
• A report on how well the models perform and the results of testing.
• Insights from scalability and stress tests.
4. Deployment Plan
• Instructions for deploying the system in a local environment.
• Maintenance and update plans for ongoing improvements.
5. User Training
• Training materials and sessions for recruiters and system administrators.
• FAQs and troubleshooting guides for users.
